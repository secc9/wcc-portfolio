	  <p>Write a short introduction, a short paragraph, giving a bit more detail about what the project is.</p>

      <p>The MC Skooghall Sound n Sight Pallette is aimed at allowing me to create an interactive GUI for the Swedish artist MC Skooghall.<br>

      <div class="flex-item">
	<p>	The MC Skooghall project is the brainchild of Swedish based noise artist Dave Proctor. MC Skooghall is an MC creating "lazy hip hop". <br>
	  My part in the collaboration is to create the beats for MC Skooghall using the Open Source Audio Programming software SuperCollider.<br>
	  I chose to use SuperCollider platform as the main sound and sequencing engine because of its power as a music producing tool.<br>
	  Many experimental musicians and sound artists use SuperCollider for its ability to create music that doesn't necesarily sound like any other artist, it's lightweight use on the computer processor due to limited gui options and also the fact that the software is free to use.
	  After discussions we have decided that since Dave is not a user of SuperCollider and has limited capacity in programming, I would go ahead and attempt to make a GUI for him to use whilst performing live, thus making his performance less stressful and then he can just focus on triggering the loops.<br>
	  The prelimanary ideas are that he has a way to trigger pre-made loops with the possibility to also display visualizations for the duration of the loop being played.<br>
	  Other ideas we explored are to possibly bundle the software as an app and also having some sort of access to it via a hand held device such as an ipad.

      <p>the beats section which needs to be addded to buttons</p>

      <p> I found that I had trouble with triggering the loops so I had to change the loop section into an Ndef to make it trigger.<br>
	I became stuck with this so I had to ask Chat GPT for a little help in hat to write for actioning the buttons</p>

      <p>changing the code in SuperCollider to reflect this</p>

	</div>
      </div>

      <p>I still had problems with the triggering of the tempo for different loops. When triggering a loop, the tempo would remain the same, instead of changing for the called loop. After some movement of code in various places, I moved the p.TempoClock code into the if statment for the button inside the GUI code as shown below</p>

      <p> Here is the start to teach myself and experiment with making visuals inside of SuperCollider<br>
	using Oloffson's Audiovisuals in SuperCollider tutorials I experimented with basic drawings</p>
