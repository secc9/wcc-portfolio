   }
   
   ** REMEMBER
   This is not for approval, just for technical and creative feedback on the ideas
Question 1:
What is a one sentence summary of your idea for the final project?


Question 2:
What are you making? Is it a game, interactive installation, instrument,
performance? Or what making context do you situate yourself within?
Think about the broader context of interaction in art and the related histories of making.
Include links or references to works that have inspired you here if applicable. 


Question 3:
What does it do or what does your viewer/user do when interacting with the work?
What do you hope the experience will be for the participant? How do you imagine it setup and where?
Feel free to include any images, (clearly labelled) hand-written sketches,
or anything you think is needed to make it clearer to your peers.
You can think about drawing an installation diagram or perhaps a user flow or systems diagram depending on your idea. 


Question 4:
What is the input to your system?


Question 5:
What is the output of your system?


Question 6:
What technologies are you using? What hardware, what software, programming languages, libraries,
what algorithms? If you are finding that more than 50% of these technologies/algorithms are ones that
you aren't already familiar with (from your modules or previous experience),
I'd advise you to re-think or include below your back up plan / Minimal Viable Product plan.
It's often helpful to make clear what tech you feel confident with here or what tests you have already done,
and include in the next question areas you are unsure about.


Question 7:
What are some challenges you might face?

Question 8:
Specific help: anything specific you'd like feedback or help with?

    *** Condsraints
  - [ ]  You must format your archive/data in a correctly formatted JSON file.
    Images or media can be in a folder, but you must also create a JSON file.
    Images and other media should be web optimised, i.e. small enough to use / manipulate online.
  - [ ] You can use p5.js to visualise your data in some way if you want this week,
    you can also just spend this week collecting or scraping,
    and then respond to or use the data next week to visualise it.
  - [ ] You should have a page on your portfolio for this week,
     if you do not visualise the data this week, please right a very short reflection (approx 300 words)
      with at least one image describing your goals and process.
  - [ ] You github page must be responsive (i.e. look good on mobile and desktop devices),
    so whether it's a full-screen experience or a smaller canvas in a nicely styled webpage,
     it should size and work nicely across devices.

* Found an AudioVisuals blog from Fredrik Olofssons www
** I'm using his Audiovisual tutorials taken from a

[[https://fredrikolofsson.com/f0blog/audiovisuals-with-sc/][olofsson av blog post]]

//audiovisual programming / mapping and visualization
//organized by lullcec, barcelona 18-20 may 2012


* I FUXCKED UP THE CSS. I DIDNT COPY OVER THE IMAGE CODE FOR THE FRONT PAGE
- [X] fix this
  DONE
  
- 

* Current catch up so far?

I think I'm on progress. I need to fill in some of the blog documentation.  But as far as the app goes I feel that I'm doing fine.

I have a working app
The buttons trigger loops on and off
One button opens a visualisation window in fullscreen mode in another display and closes it when the button is pressed again.

So far there feels as though there are no bugs in my code (YET!)

** I'm feeling quite good about this progress

* Things to do

- [ ] more work on drawing in SuperCollider
- [ ] start to make visuals for each loop
- [ ] think about adding audio meters into the GUI window
- [ ] think about adding a scope into the GUI window
- [ ] maybe some kind of overall pitch slider for the loops (DJ Decks style?)
- [ ] make the xfader do something? Or do I really need it?
- [ ] maybe i can have a library of audio files which could open onto a "deck"??
- [ ] maybe turn it into a standalone app?
  
  
- 
* THINGS TO REMEMBER
- [ ] REMEMBER TO UDATE TO GIT PRETTY REGULARLY
- [ ] RESIZE IMAGES TO SOMETHING SMALLER AS GIT DESKTOP DOESNT LIKE LARGE IMAGES AND IT HANGS THEN YOU HAVE TO DELETE THE REPO AND START AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN :( SAD AND ANGRY EMOJI
- [ ] FIND A WAY TO STOP A PUSH IF ITS HANGING DUE TO LARGE FILES
-
