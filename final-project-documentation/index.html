      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <!--
	  <p>Write a short introduction, a short paragraph, giving a bit more detail about what the project is.</p>

      <p>The MC Skooghall Sound n Sight Pallette is aimed at allowing me to create an interactive GUI for the Swedish artist MC Skooghall.<br>
	Creating an application for live musical performance and visualizations.

	<p>The MC Skooghall project is the brainchild of Swedish based noise artist Dave Proctor. MC Skooghall is an MC creating "lazy hip hop". <br>
	  My part in the collaboration is to create the beats for MC Skooghall using the Open Source Audio Programming software SuperCollider.<br>
	  I chose to use SuperCollider platform as the main sound and sequencing engine because of its power as a music producing tool.<br>
	  Many experimental musicians and sound artists use SuperCollider for its ability to create music that doesn't necesarily sound like any other artist,
	  it's lightweight use on the computer processor due to limited gui options and also the fact that the software is free to use.
	  After discussions we have decided that since Dave is not a user of SuperCollider and has limited capacity in programming,
	  I would go ahead and attempt to make a GUI for him to use whilst performing live, thus making his performance less stressful and then he can just focus on triggering the loops.<br>
	  The prelimanary ideas are that he has a way to trigger pre-made loops with the possibility to also display visualizations for the duration of the loop being played.<br>
	  Other ideas we explored are to possibly bundle the software as an app and also having some sort of access to it via a hand held device such as an ipad.

      <p> Here I am writing about the process of implimenting the project? <br>
	What technical elements are involved? <br>

	The process of this project has been a steady one. As a sometimes user of SuperCollider
	I didn't really have much in the way of problems whilst creating the music for this project, as that is the part of the software
	I'm familiar with. Work slowed down when it came to creating functionality within the gui, such as triggering loops with buttons
	and making the visualization windows open and close on the same button press.
	After figuring this out I moves on to trying to control the app via touchOSC. Here is where I began running into real problems.

      <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->

      <p>the beats section which needs to be addded to buttons</p>

	</div>
      </div>
      
      <p> I found that I had trouble with triggering the loops so I had to change the loop section into an Ndef to make it trigger.<br>
	I became stuck with this so I had to ask Chat GPT for a little help in hat to write for actioning the buttons</p>

      <p>changing the code in SuperCollider to reflect this</p>

	<div class="flex-item">
	  <img src="../assets/images/sc_shot_06.png"/>
	</div>
      </div>

      <p>I still had problems with the triggering of the tempo for different loops. When triggering a loop, the tempo would remain the same, instead of changing for the called loop. After some movement of code in various places, I moved the p.TempoClock code into the if statment for the button inside the GUI code as shown below</p>

      <p> Here is the start to teach myself and experiment with making visuals inside of SuperCollider<br>
	using Oloffson's Audiovisuals in SuperCollider tutorials I experimented with basic drawings</p>

    <p>I'm now at the point of making a visualizer window appear and close on a button press. I do have an issue about having the window open on a different display though.<br>
      I made some video documntation for this which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Szn1uVKvPmw">here.</a> <br>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/QDz0yvqDtPc">Here</a> I've begun to add that the window opens in fullscreen on a separate display. Allowing the gui to be used on a laptop and the visualisaion to be projected</p>


    <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
    <p>Reflect on how the project went, what went well, what you learn etc. Based in these reflections, conclude with how you would further develop this project if you were to make another version or how you would further develop your ideas.</p>

    <p>
      So far with working on this project I felt that everything didn't go so bad. I refreshed my knowledge of SuperCollider with running through
      some tutorial files each day in both the audio and visualization parts of it. Unfortunatley SuperCollider does not have much in the way of
      documentation and tutorials for visuals and GUI as many people use the application for experimantal composition.
